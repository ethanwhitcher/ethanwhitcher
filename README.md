👋 Hey, I'm Ethan! I'm currently going into my 3rd year at Queen's University studying Computer Engineering. I enjoy solving real-world problems through software development and technology. I'm currently at Zafin this summer as a Software Engineering Intern!

💻 Feel free to reach out for project collaborations or hackathons!

⌨️ Currently working on Playlist.AI

📚 Technologies I am using right now: Python, Javascript/Typescript, Java Spring Boot, Spotify API, and NodeJS (Express).
