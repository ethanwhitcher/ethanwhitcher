👋 Hey, I'm Ethan! I'm currently in my 2nd year at Queen's University studying Computer Engineering. I enjoy solving real-world problems through software development and technology. I'm currently interning at Zafin this summer as a Software Engineering Intern!

💻 Feel free to reach out for project collaborations or hackathons!
